**pnpm**

This project also uses pnpm as it's package manager. Install `pnpm` by running `npm i -g pnpm` in your terminal.

**npm packages**

Run `pnpm i` to install the npm packages.

### Running the Development Server

First, run the development server:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
